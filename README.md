## Glaucoma Diagnosis And Segmentation

During this challenge, we tried to diagnose glaucoma from images of the inside back surface of the eye. Our motivation is to
develop a deep learning system that can detect glaucoma disease. We aim to work with multiple convolutional neural network
models UNet, VGG, and AlexNet and test different kinds of data augmentation. Later we can choose the best performing
model.
